# starboard
A simple Discord bot to automate pinning with limited user permissions, written in async Python.

See Discord's (or discord.py's) documentation for details on how to run this bot in your server.

Make sure you create a file called `bot_key.py` with a variable `key` set to the string value of your bot key from Discord's developer control panel.
